## Overview
Supply chain major with a strong interest in building practical software that improves real workflows. I’m actively transitioning deeper into software development by learning through hands-on projects rather than tutorials.

- Workflow automation & internal tools  
- Data modeling and state-driven systems

## Learning Focus
- Writing cleaner, more readable JavaScript  
- Lua scripting for FiveM and server-side logic  
- Understanding backend concepts (APIs, data flow, state, auth)  
- Relational databases and schema design

## Current Projects
**Purchase Order Lifecycle Tool**  
A personal project to better understand backend systems and data modeling by recreating real procurement workflows: POs, approvals, lead times, and delivery tracking.

**Mobile Detailing Website**  
Small business website focused on practical UX and real deployment, not frameworks for the sake of it.

## Collaboration
I’m dedicated, curious, and willing to put in the work.  
Open to helping on projects where I can learn, contribute, and grow — especially backend, automation, or systems-focused work.
